"Camera Detection leverages live camera feeds to perform real-time object detection. "
"It is highly effective for applications requiring immediate feedback and interaction. "
"The detection process analyzes the captured frames continuously to identify objects, making it "
    ideal for tasks such as:
        1. Real-time surveillance and security monitoring.
        2. Augmented Reality (AR) applications in gaming and education.
        3. Robotics and automation for dynamic environments."
