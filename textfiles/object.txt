"Object Detection"
    Object Detection is a computer vision task that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. 
    Using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it combines image classification with object 
    localization to detect multiple objects simultaneously with high accuracy and real-time performance.

"Applications of Object Detection"
    Object detection is used across various industries:

    1.Autonomous Vehicles: Identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles for safe navigation.
    2.Healthcare: Diagnosing medical images, such as detecting tumors in radiology scans.
    3.Retail: Inventory management and theft prevention.
    4.Surveillance: Enhancing security by monitoring activities in real-time.
    5.Agriculture: Analyzing crop health and detecting pests.
    6.Sports Analytics: Tracking player movements and game dynamics.
    7.Robotics: Enabling robots to interact with their environment effectively.

"Object Detection Working"
    Deep learning models, especially CNNs, process images to:
    1.Extract Features: Identify patterns at multiple layers.
    2.Predict Bounding Boxes: Enclose detected objects.
    3.Classify Objects: Recognize object categories.

"Object Detection Models"
    Some widely used models include:
    1.YOLO (You Only Look Once): Known for speed and accuracy.
    2.SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): Balances speed and precision.
    3.Faster R-CNN: Focuses on high accuracy.

"Advancements in Object Detection"
    Recent advances include:
    1.Real-time Processing: For applications needing instant results.
    2.Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models on new tasks, reducing data requirements.
