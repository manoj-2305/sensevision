"Image Detection focuses on analyzing static images to identify and locate objects within them. "
"Using deep learning techniques, this process scans the image for patterns, edges, and features to "
"detect objects accurately. Image Detection is widely used in applications such as:
        1. Facial recognition for security and personalization.
        2. Analyzing medical images for disease diagnosis.
        3. Detecting objects in satellite imagery for environmental monitoring.
